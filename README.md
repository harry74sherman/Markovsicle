# Markovsicle

# Description

This project uses a Java based IDE called processing to create a representation of what
my tips would be like after a day of work on an ice cream truck depending on the weather.
Suprisingly, I could generally tell how much I would make in tips based on the weather from
the day before, because this summer, cloudy days were often followed by cloudy days, and
sunny days were often followed by sunny days. The sunnier the day, the better the tips.
Therefore, this scenario was an ideal fit for a Markov chain! This system runs by randomly 
generating the weather from the day before, and then depicting the weather for the next day
based on a markov transition matrix. The coins that fall and land on the bottom represent
the tips that I could expect to take home at the end of the day, and the falling icecream
represent the general sales and "energy" (or to use an equally vague word, the "vibe") on
on the beaches that day. 

# How to run
Once this project is in the processing IDE, all that you need to do is click the play button,
and enjoy!

# How this sytem is meaningful to me

This summer, I took on a side-hustle as an ice-cream truck driver as something to get me away
from my remote internship that saw me stapled to my desk for eight hours a day. Oddly enough,
my weekends on the truck were some of the most fun times I’ve ever had at “work”. After nearly
a hundred hours of screen time accumulated throughout the week, many of which were spent doing 
arduous testing and debugging of software, the mindless, regimented task of carrying dozens of 
boxes of fudgesicles, bomb-pops, chipwiches, and many other classic ice cream bars onto the
truckfelt like bliss.

Before going to the lot, I would look out my window for an indication of how business would be
that day. The formula was pretty clear: If there was sun, business would boom. I often felt
nervous with all of the foot traffic near the truck amid a pandemic, but the tips I would amass
over 6 hours driving from beach to beach on Cape Cod made it hard for anyone to pass up (and
the truck was loaded with masks, gloves, cleaning spray, hand sanitizer, etc). The animation
I created with money and ice cream flying around the screen succinctly captures one of my 
lucrative summer Sundays. 

However, when I looked out my window to see clouds and in lieu of the sun, I knew my time on
the truck would crawl by. The gray sky and hardly visible sun would cause tips to suffer, and
my shift would often be cut in half via a text from my boss telling me to “shut it down”. My
animation also captures what it was like on one of those sad, gray days. Tips were down, the
coolers stayed full, and the energy dwindled. Nonetheless, this project is meaningful to me 
because it allowed me to reminisce about one of the most fun summer experiences I’ve ever had. 

# How this challenged me as a computer scientist

Almost immediately after reading the project description, I went searching for a python library 
that would help to create this “vision” I had in my mind. I searched and searched and searched,
and I even tried a couple out. All in vain. I had convinced myself to stay in python, being by
far my strongest language. I hadn’t used java since my sophomore fall in data structures, and
none of my other classes thus far had large programming components. Even when they did, I always
programmed in python. 

When I asked my friend Kayla if she had found a good library or toolbox for the assignment, she
mentioned that she was using a java based IDE called Processing. I’ve always been anxious about 
starting a new IDE, let alone a non-python one, but I gave it a shot nonetheless. I was thrilled
to see that there was a python setting, but after starting the assignment in python, I recognized
the opportunity to challenge myself and freshen up my java skills, and jumped on it. 

Before starting the project, the “vision” in my head for the project was very 2-dimensional.
However, while I was getting acquainted with the new IDE I would be using, I quickly fell into a 
“documentation rabbit-hole”, something I never knew existed. There are so many amazing things 
that can be done in this IDE, and I loved challenging myself to try different animations and effects,
some of which ended up in my final project. I truly hope I get to work in this environment again, even
if it’s outside of this course. I’ve always been curious about animation, but never really knew a 
way to start. This was an important challenge for me because I hope to pursue a career at the 
intersection of the arts and technology, so I’m really happy that I challenged myself to engage with
a new tool and try out some tricky animations and effects. Nonetheless, I know I’m hardly scratching 
the surface of what’s possible with this software. 

In terms of what's next, I would savor the opportunity to continue developing this project. While
these animations may seem trivial, they took me a decent amount of time to implement because I was 
just getting used this these IDE and coding style, as well and trying to reteach myself java. I believe
that I can make something a lot more useful and exciting with processing if given more time to expand
on this. I also hope to continue making animations, and look into making graphical user interfaces with
Processing.

# Assessing the "creativity" of this system

Based on what metrics, definition, or criteria are used, this system could be considered creative.
Some aspects of this system are unique–I don’t think anyone has built a “day on the ice cream truck”
simulation before. However, the underlying animation code (making images fall like rain, in the 
3D-esque way, images falling to the bottom of the screen, etc.) are almost certainly only novel to me,
as I’m sure they’ve been done before. Therefore, I guess this system is more P-creative than H-creative.
It is P-creative to me because I learned many new skills and made something unique and interesting to
myself, but I don’t believe others would find this system to be of any use.

Kayla Snyder for showing me this software. I also consulted the documentation of Processing frequently
and I also consulted an online example of a python MARKOV chain, but didn't ended using it for anything
other than the general structure of a markov chain, which I then implemented in java. Linked below.
